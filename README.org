** TODO
- [X] try to avoid downloading pre-trained model while 1st time running
- [X] host trained model on cloud object, to reduce container size
- [ ] code annotation
- [ ] restrict non-image file upload
- [ ] file size
- [ ] handle post data
- [ ] return top-k predictions
- [ ] handle non-recognition
- [ ] check ONNX or other ways hosting model
