** TODO
- [X] try to avoid downloading pre-trained model while 1st time running
- [X] host trained model on cloud object, to reduce container size
- [ ] code annotation
- [X] restrict non-image file upload
- [X] file size
- [X] handle post data
- [ ] more types of image for uploading
- [ ] try to mount the model as a volume to avoid downloading from storage
- [ ] return top-k predictions
- [ ] handle non-recognition
- [ ] check ONNX or other ways hosting model
